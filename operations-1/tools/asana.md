# Asana

## Main Projects

### Product Roadmap

This project contains the main backlog of the main features we are working on.

## Project Template

### Sections

We use some standard sections across the projects that will help manage and sync the projects.

These sections are design to work well on the Kanban **Board** view.

| Section | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Inbox** | This should be the top sections, and new tasks created by colleagues will be automatically be added there to be triaged. |
| **Sprint** | This is whats is being worked on during the current sprint, usually a week. |
| **Backlog** | Task that are ready to be developed.  |
| **Done** | All the completed tasks should be moved here. |

### Automations Rules

We need to turn on some automations to keep the tasks organised.
