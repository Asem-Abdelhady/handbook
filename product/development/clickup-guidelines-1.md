# ClickUp Guidelines

- as soon as you get something to work on that is in \``TODO`\` status, change it to \``IN PROGRESS`\`  
- if you find a blocker or have an important question to ask, change the status to \``BLOCKED`\` and add a comment on the task  
- when you finish developing the fix move it to \``WAITING REVIEW`\` and notify me - either via a comment on the task or adding me as a reviewer on GitHub  
- if you start reviewing another one's task, change it to \``IN REVIEW`\`  
- if the review was not good, move it to \``IN PROGRESS`\` again and make sure to communicate properly  
- if the review was fine change it to \``DONE`\` and approve the PR on GitHub
