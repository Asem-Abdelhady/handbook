# Principles

### Building Blocks Oriented 

While designing an interface, take a step back and analyze the overall possibilities of using existing components of our framework. Ultimately, as more the user interacts with the same component, as smooth the learning curve of other UI using this component will be. 

### Recognition Rather than Recall 

Do not overload the user's memory, add visual cues through their journey so they can recognize rather than recall. The recognition is easier than recall because it is connected to more cues; information spread which activate that related information in their memory. 

### Spotlight

Its purpose is to direct the audience's attention, as fewer Spotlight areas we have at the same time, as focused the users will be on their current task. 

### Design Together

Design is made by the collaboration of different people, with different backgrounds. 

### Consistent and Meaningful Motion 

Real-world is not static so the product either. However, the motion must be consistent on its timing and curve as well as meaningful, leaving cues to the audience so they can understand the affordance of a component.
