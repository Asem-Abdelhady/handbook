# OFFICE RULES

## Doors and alarm passcodes

If you don't have a passcode for the gate door, the office door or the alarm, contact Marcelo Schmidt ([@marcelo.schmidt](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/marcelo.schmidt)) to get your passcode setup.

## Leaving the office

If you are the last to leave the office at any given day, here's a checklist you have to follow before leaving:

### Upstairs

- Turn off all 5 air conditioners (two on the main room, one on each meeting room).
- Turn lights off. 
- Don't have to worry about the windows on the meeting rooms.

### Kitchen / Laundry

- Close and lock the iron door to the patio. Remove the keys and store on the kitchen's locker (in front of the fridge).
- Close kitchen windows.
- Turn lights off.

### Main office

- Close and lock the office doors that face the patio.
- Close and lock the office windows that face the patio.
- Close and lock the office door that face the passage.
- Turn lights off.

### Hallway

- Make sure the door behind you is closed.
- Input your office door passcode followed by # and lift the handle to properly lock the door.
- Knock on Avus door to check if everyone has left as well.
- If nobody else is in the building, turn on the alarm.
- For the next 60s, the alarm will be off for the gate door. Leave, making sure the gate door is properly closed after leaving.
