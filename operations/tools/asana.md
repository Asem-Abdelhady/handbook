# Asana

## Main Projects

### Product Roadmap

This project contains the main backlog of the main features we are working on.

## Project Template

### Sections

We need some standard sections across the projects that will help manage and sync the projects

| Section | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Inbox | This should be the top sections, and new tasks created by colleagues will be automatically be added there to be triaged. |
| Sprint | This is whats is being worked on during the current sprint, usually a week. |

### Automations Rules

We need to turn on some automations to keep the tasks organised.
