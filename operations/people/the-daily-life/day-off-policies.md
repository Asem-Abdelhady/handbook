# Day-off Policies

## Birthdays

On your birthday you get automatic PTO! I This is a really special day for everyone, so this way you can feel free to celebrate it with your loved ones and in the best way you can!   
  
You don't have to worry about submitting a request for it on Zoho People. Simply consider birthday notifications on our \#important channel as a PTO notification also, so consider all birthday folks as "out"!

## Holidays

The Zorro app has a list of holidays it uses to send the notifications on our \#important channel. You can check the list for your country on the following link by changing the final letters for the correct abbreviation of your country's name: [https://date.nager.at/api/v2/publicholidays/2020/br](https://date.nager.at/api/v2/public%3Cmark%3Eholiday%3C/mark%3Es/2020/br)  
  
Whenever you have a local holiday coming up and it is **not** on the list you can either:   
1. Call someone from the People team to announce the Holiday on \#important  
2. Just post a message complementing the automatic one that Zorro sends on important on the holiday, saying what is the holiday and where it applies to.

## Vacations

We advise all Rocketeers, no matter where you live, to take at least 20 days of vacation a year \(apart from PTO\). This is important for you to have some cool down time and to maintain a healthy relationship with work. In the case of Brazilian Rocketeers, you respond to the CLT vacation rules. 

  
On none of these cases we'll be able to "block" your calendar in advance, so we strongly advise you to block these days in your Google Calendar a while before to prevent people from scheduling any meetings on these special days!
