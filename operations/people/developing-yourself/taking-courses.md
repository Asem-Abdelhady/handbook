# Learning things

## Italki

Train your English or learn a new language talking to native speaker teachers!   
In the platform, the company will give you monthly $100 to spend on classes if you want to!

## Other courses and books

Want to do a course or buy a book to develop a technical skill?   
We have a few options in this case:

* **For simple courses and/or technical books with low cost:** Rocket.Chat pays for the full price of this segment. 
* **For more complex courses and/or books with a higher cost:** In this case we use the 70/30 rule, in which the company pays for the 70% of the price and the Rocketeer 30%.

Anytime you want or need any of these to improve your technical skills, feel more than free to reach out to the People team or to our COO. We'll then evaluate your case and give you an answer about which segment your course fits into. When approved, you can buy the course, send us a receipt and we'll reimburse you.

There are only a few exceptions to this policy, and they are:

* **Long duration and high cost courses:** Such as MBAs and Post-graduate programs.
