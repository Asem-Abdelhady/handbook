## Meeting the team

If you are working remotely, we recommend you arrange meetings with Gabriel and at least nine other team members using the [team page](https://rocket.chat/team). Ensure that you speak to team members from a range of departments.

## Add yourself to the team page

The [Rocket.Chat team page](https://rocket.chat/team) shows the members of the core Rocket.Chat team. The list is ordered by start date with the most recent members at the bottom.

Each team member is featured with their job title, professional photo and link to their GitHub profile (if appropriate).

It is each team member's responsibility to add their own information and photo to the page once they join. The below section shows you how to do this.

### Prerequisites

2. Create a branch with an appropriate name `add-firstname-lastname-to-team-page`.

### Add your profile

  - `department`: from your contract
  - `username`: Rocket.Chat username in the format `firstname.lastname`
  - `github_username`: GitHub username to link your profiles
  - `github_uid`: GitHub user id, add if you want to use your GitHub profile photo
  - `photo`: **yes/no** If you've added your own photo to the website
