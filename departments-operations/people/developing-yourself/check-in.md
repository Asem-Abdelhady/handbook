# Performance and Career Check-in

The Check-in is the most important tool and milestone for the development of our Rocketeers. It goes beyond an evaluation of performance, since it was designed to attend to three main goals:

* Evaluating performance
* Aligning expectations about career growth
* Developing the career path of our Rocketeers

Our Check-in cycle is hosted at [Qulture.Rocks](https://app.qulture.rocks) and Rocketeers can login by using their Google accounts (the platform is configured as to only allow login from @rocket.chat emails).  &#x20;

## The process

A Check-in in composed by 5 steps:

* Indications stage
* Validation stage
* Answer period
* Reports
* Development Plan

To walk you through the step by step of each of them, here is the [recorded training](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sy0cT\_QVaSLExl-IOBQFCbfR-zNOz1lz/view?usp=sharing) and the [introduction material](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1edbLeP28it4bCZkkao5CB4PM0NbbXsEUQGzMAmVMChU/edit?usp=sharing). If you're a leader, [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bFeRh1KInC6zTxLiDifgWr7pIkMtoUfghqL\_fX75elQ/edit?usp=sharing)'s a guide on how to do each of your tasks during the process. In Qulture.Rocks' knowledge base you'll also find a collection of [tutorials](https://help.qulture.rocks/en/collections/2438024-performance-evaluation#tutorial-for-employees) to help you during the process.

### Indications stage

The default evaluations everyone will fill are a self-review, a review of the manager and of any direct reports, but you also have the option to indicate peers to evaluate you. Leaders can also indicate if they want someone to evaluate one of their team members.&#x20;

If you want to participate in a peer's evaluation and give them a review just talk to them and ask them to indicate you or ask your leader to indicate you to evaluate them. Here are the three basic rules you need to follow regarding indications:

1. The system will **limit the number of peer indications** to 5 to everyone.
2. If you received more than 5 indications, during the indications or validation stages feel free to **refuse indications** from the Rocketeers you have less contact with and, therefore, less to contribute with. We indicate reviewing up to 5 peers in order to do a deep and healthy review.
3. Indications **will not be created by system admins **after the indication period in order to maintain the freedom of evaluators to choose who to evaluate.

### Validation stage

At this stage leaders will validate their teams' indications, they may remove or add people if they believe someone's input could be more valuable to your development based on their understanding of your work routine.&#x20;

As previously mentioned, you **can and should review all indications you received** during this step, selecting around 5 from the people you have the most contact with and can contribute the most to.&#x20;

In the end of the validation stage all indications left will be automatically validated by the system.&#x20;

### Answer period

In this stage you'll answer your self-evaluation, review your manager, any direct reports you have, and any indications you received. Youâ€™ll answer:

* **Your profile:** In this one we want to look into your interests and aspirations. You know that dream of yours? That random skill you have? That position you aspire? This is the place to talk about it. To find it, just click on "Open profile" below your name on the home page of Qulture.Rocks.
* **Check-in Survey:** This is the survey you'll answer inside the Review module.&#x20;

### Reports

After the reviews are submitted, a report containing the results of the review will be generated and released **by the leaders**. This will be an important output that you'll use, together with your profile as an input for your feedback session with your leader and creation of your Development Plan. We indicate the release of the reports to be done close to the feedback session.

### Development Plan

After the answer period, comes the time for you and your leader to get together for the feedback session. You'll go over the report, understand the difference in perspective of the responses you received and the possible reason for that, read your profile and talk about your aspirations, and all that will point to the _development areas_ you should focus on for the next semester.&#x20;
