# Departmental Onboarding

The process of departmental onboarding to be described in this section was developed with the help of our Rocketeers, after surveys and workshops were conducted to receive their inputs, an **ideal standard onboarding** to any team was created.

Other teams might have onboardings with additional routines or items, but the process described here is what is considered the minimum expected from any area-specific onboarding.

### Initial guidelines

To begin, it's important to establish three basic guidelines about the area onboarding in order to achieve a smooth process that doesn't overwhelm its participant:

* Mix types of content in support documents - only long videos or long texts aren't the ideals
* Learning hands-on! Start with small activities, learn with the process, and slowly evolve
* Slowly expand the “world” of knowledge the person is having contact with to avoid being overwhelmed

### General structure

To guarantee that the new team member feels supported without depending only on a manager or one team member, it's important to create the structure of 3 support lines:

1. Manager
2. Buddy
3. Documentation

Each of these three will play different parts during each step of the onboarding. Let's walk through them and understand the different roles:

## Pre-Onboarding

During the week prior to the new team member's first day, **the Manager is responsible for**:

1. Notifying the team on its main channel (_onboarding date, name, and role_)
2. Assigning a Buddy from the team for the new Rocketeer and communicating with them
3. Scheduling a welcome meeting for introductions (ideally on the New Rocketeer's first day)

It's pre-aligned that the initial focus for new Rocketeers during the first 2 days should be going through the company onboarding, and as soon as they're done with it they're ready to get started in their new team. Since the certification is self-paced, there's no better way to know when the person is available than communicating! Therefore, managers should use this welcome meeting to align with the new hire date for the kick-off meeting of the Area Onboarding.&#x20;

## Onboarding

The Onboarding stage starts when the initial departmental onboarding meeting is held - the one scheduled during the first contact. **This kick-off meeting should include the new team member, the manager, and the assigned buddy** and cover:

* General details about the department, the team, the area's OKRs and initiatives, and other suggested topics to discuss are:
  * Overview of the product
  * Who are the area's main stakeholders
  * Current priorities of the area (big issues, responsibilities, etc)
* Align role and short-term expectations
* Introduce the buddy to the new member&#x20;

We consider a new Rocketeer is in the Onboarding stage during the first month in the company, and during this time:

#### The Manager should:

1. Conduct kick-off meeting&#x20;
2. Introduce the new team member to the team and promote a quick self-introduction
3. Add a new team member to all relevant channels, discussions, and meeting invites
4. Provide access to all relevant links (drive folders, files, tools, spreadsheets, etc)
5. Schedule recurring 1:1 meetings with new team member **(at least every 15 days, but ideally weekly during the first month)**
6. [Here´s](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fWg1roczPgTqeuSjCWNdUj7nvAsRmZ7aL962UwMlFC8/edit#slide=id.ge5371f3319\_0\_0) a Leader´s Checklist to not miss a thing
7. **Optional:** Use the Jira template onboarding project to coordinate your tasks and deadlines along the process to remind both yourself and the new member of the onboarding tasks to be completed during the first month. You can use it to create new tasks to help the person walk through documentation or repositories in an organized way.

#### The Buddy should:

1. Use the kick-off meeting to introduce themselves
2. Help the New Rocketeer adjust to the team, its ceremonies, and meetings
3. Be present especially during their first two weeks to support them with tools, processes, and guidance - _Remember it's not only understanding the tool itself but also how the area organizes it and uses it on a daily basis_
4. Be available for any questions or doubts

#### The Documentation should:

The area should create documentation both for processes and tools, especially those that everyone in the area will have contact with. Having this in place brings back the initial guideline about mixing types of content, allowing the Rocketeer to also learn by going through the area's practices described in the internal handbook whenever necessary, optimizing the time spent by the manager and/or buddy.  &#x20;

#### Finally, the new Team Member should:

1. Complete the New Rocketeer Certification in training.rocket.chat
2. **Optional:** Schedule 1:1s with main team members to introduce yourself, understand the role of your team member and their activities, and how your roles connect - _You can ask your buddy and your manager who they suggest._
