# Company Onboarding

Before you first join our team you'll receive the instructions for your admission and other additional documents and materials you need to start in Rocket.Chat. A few days before your start date, you'll also receive the initial instructions along with your RC Google Workspace credentials. [HereÂ´s](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10MWbCqEI1X5zAVQvLQj2wx-\_AApiS3dLB6nTYVrLe74/edit#slide=id.gaedb49bd54\_0\_245) a guide made for our New Rocketeers so they know what to expect.

The first two steps after having your Google Workspace account in hand are:

* Log in [open.rocket.chat](../../community/community-management/open.rocket.chat.md)
* Sign in [training.rocket.chat](https://training.rocket.chat/) using your Google account

After you complete the first step we'll be able to locate you inside the open server of Rocket.Chat adding you to our private teams and channels. While the second step will allow us to give you access to our New Rocketeer Certification.&#x20;

The certification will give you a good foundation of knowledge about the company, our processes, the platforms we use, and more! So it's **essential** that your first days are dedicated to completing the course at your own pace.&#x20;

1. Understand who is Rocket.Chat, from both the product and business points of view.
2. Get resources to identify teams and departmental representatives that are there to help you.
3. Find out more about the aspects of your daily life as a Rocketeer.
4. Review the tools and systems you will use on a daily basis.

During your first day, you'll have an Onboarding Meeting with the People Team for a welcome session. You will also have checkpoint sessions on your 1st, 3rd, and 6th months to check on you.

### Open Source Townhall & CEO Onboarding

If you're a new Rocketeer, it's beneficial that you don't miss our Townhall Meeting!

The Open Source Townhall & CEO Onboarding is for every new Rocketeer who wants to:

1. Understand more about our open-source background and how it affects our culture code
2. Get to know our CEO and our CppO, and ask them a few questions in a Q\&A session.

This meeting is scheduled for all New Rocketeers at the end of the first month with us.
