# Company Onboarding

Before you first join our team you'll receive the instructions for your admission and other additional documents and materials you need to start in Rocket.Chat. Until a few days before your start date, when you'll receive the basic initial instructions along with your company Gsuite credentials.

The first two steps after having your Gsuite account in hand are:

* Register in [open.rocket.chat](../../community/community-management/open.rocket.chat.md), following the company username format: @firstname.lastname
* Sign in [training.rocket.chat](https://training.rocket.chat) using your Google account

After you complete the first we'll be able to locate you inside the open server of Rocket.Chat in order to add you to our private team and channels. While the second step will allow us to give you access to our New Rocketeer Certification.&#x20;

The certification will give you a very good foundation of knowledge about the company, our processes, the platforms we use, and more! So it's **essential** that your first days are dedicated to completing the course at your own pace. While going through it you will:

1. Understand who is Rocket.Chat, from both the product and business points of view.
2. Get resources to identify the team and departmental representatives that are there to help you.
3. Discover more about our products and the messaging we typically use when we talk about them.
4. Find out more about the aspects of Your daily life as a Rocketeer.
5. Review the tools and systems you will use on a daily basis.

During your first day you'll have an onboarding meeting with the People team for a quick welcome session, where you'll be able to meet the fellow Rocketeers joining with you and also receive a few important reminders.&#x20;

On day 1 you will also already have access to the course, and after around three days the People team will get back in touch to follow up if you have any questions or need any support before moving on to the Departmental onboarding.
