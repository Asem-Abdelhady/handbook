# Engineering Onboarding

## I-Objective:

The purpose of this document is to generate a common approach to onboarding of engineers to the different squads. The information contained here might be used for new hires or for engineers changing to a different squad.

## II-Pre-Onboarding:

1\. During the week prior to new engineer boarding engineering manager should notify the squad using squad’s team or main channel. Message should contain boarding date, name and job role.

2.Engineer manager should also assign an engineer from the squad to be newcomer focal for assistance and questions.

3.As possible engineering manager is expected to sent handbook link to new member and squad general details.

4.If engineer is a new rocketeer, the engineering manager should set a 30 min 1:1 meeting for 1st day.  For engineer squad changes jump to section III.3.

## III-Onboarding on engineering:

1.On joining day, engineering manager conducts the 1:1 meeting to share general details on squad, engineer focal contacts, squad meetings to be attended, mention the different talent team on-boarding activities and share short term expectations.

2.During the first available squad meeting (daily, planning, retro or other) engineering manager is expected to present the new member to others on the squad, and let new engineer give a quick self-introduction.

3.Engineer manager should add new engineer to all relevant squad channels.

4.Engineering focal should set a call for initial 2 days of new engineer for introductions and high-level view on section IV of this page. During this meeting main squad contacts should be shared with new engineer.

5.New squad engineer should schedule 1:1s with main squad members (lead, pm, tle, chapter focal and others that might be applicable). Recommended agenda for meeting is:

A-Get to know \<squad member name and job role>

B-Understand the person role and main activities

C-Anything I \<the new engineer> can help with?
