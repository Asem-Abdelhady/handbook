# Engineering Important Definitions

## I-Purpose of this document:

Define key concepts that are regularly mentioned by engineering.&#x20;

## II-Key definitions:

**A-Breaking Change** -> Breaking Changes are modifications to code that impact functionality of a Rocket.Chat component and require other people/applications to make a corresponding change to prevent items from stop working.

A few situations that generate breaking changes include, but are not limited to: &#x20;

路         Changes to a method signature.

路         changes to the behavior of a method.

路         changes to settings/configuration.

路         Deprecated items.

**B - Bug** -> Bugs are defects or miss behaviors experienced by end users on a released version of rocket.chat

**C - Deprecation**-> Process of taking older code and marking it as no longer being useful within the codebase, usually because it has been superseded by newer code.

**D - LTS** -> Long Term Support: identify the last minor version before a major version, e.g. 2.4 is the last minor before 3.x. A new major version means that the version introduces breaking changes and requires attention to the upgrade, so we maintain the support of the previous version for a longer time in order to give you more time to plan and test the upgrade.

**E - Beta version** -> A pre-release version of Rocket.Chat. When in the end of the development cycle, the Engineering Team will release a candidate version to be tested internally.

**F - Regression** -> Similar to bugs, but on beta versions of a release. Regressions are defects encountered on pieces of software/functionality that is **NOT** yet on a released version of Rocket.Chat, i.e., the issue was introduced in the current development cycle.
