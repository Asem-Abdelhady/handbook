# Awareness and Training

Awareness means putting someoneÂ´s attention on security challenges. Training means giving people the right level of security skills for their job.

### Awareness

At Rocket.Chat, we can build on a tech-savvy team that has a broad knowledge of security topics and specializations. Therefore we focus on raising an awareness on new things that happen. Goal: Keep all members of Rocket.Chat appraised of new and current developments in the security landscape

We are not a large size organization, so putting up programs for formal awareness measurement are currently not efficient to establish. We rather focus on ad-hoc awareness topics that are in line with our organizational direction. We use the following measures:

* Every new member gets a personal introduction into our security policies as part of his onboarding
* Policy updates are posted in the #important channel
* New vulnerabilities & industry news are submitted in the respective channels, e.g. #important, #random or #dev, to allow for an ongoing discussions
* Annually, all members of the organization submit a policy acknowledgment, meaning: the have to read the policies
* Weekly, we add important news in the company newsletter

### Training

Goal: Provide all rocket.chat members with the security skills fitting to their job profile and career path

We are not a large size organization and often dont have strict organizational boundaries. Therefore members of different teams often need skills of another team, this goes for security as well. We are also a product centric company with a growing footprint providing services (e.g. cloud offering). We use the following measures:

* Every new member gets a personal introduction into our security policies as part of his onboarding
* All trainings provided should be recorded and available on request
* All trainings should accommodate for remote participation
* Trainings should focus on on-demand topics and have a workshop character rather than classroom training. Team Leads can contact the security team to provide a training for specific areas.
* We aim to provide one training half a year.
* Topics-wise, the main subject matter areas are: Secure Development Lifecycle, Securing Cloud Services, Web Application Security, SecDevOps
* Where there is internal expertise missing, we consider leveraging external specialists.
* Training outcomes (e.g. application of security principles in a PR) should be highlighted in our RC chan
