# Data Classification and Management

### Scope:

This data classification policy applies to all data and to all user-developed data sets and systems that may access these data, regardless of the environment where the data reside (including cloud systems, servers, personal computers, mobile devices, etc.). The policy applies regardless of the media on which data reside (including electronic, microfiche, printouts, CD, etc.) or the form they may take (text, graphics, video, voice, etc.) Your private opinion, e.g. what you share on social media under your personal name, is not in scope of this policy. You should always make clear if you are posting in the name of Rocket.Chat or privately, if the context leaves room for ambiguity.

### Classifications:

All data you create, modify, receive or otherwise process in connection with Rocket.Chat, must be handled confidentially and protected according to the risk related to it. (Confidential Data). Your NDA includes more details on what is considered confidential and what not. We do not distinguish between various levels of confidentiality (like secret, top secret, super secret, ...).

An exception to confidentiality of data applies when the data in question is specifically targeted at a broader audience outside the organization (e.g. blog posts, webinars, public source code). This data is classified as "public". (Public Data).

In case a customer has a different way of classifying data and we are required to follow the customer´s classification scheme (either by contract or because it is custom), then the customer classification scheme applies. (Customer Data Classification)

### Handling and marking of data, incl. access control:

Unless stated otherwise, the creator of data is considered its owner and has to ensure the provisions of this policy are followed. Our general policy is that access to data is denied by default within the company, unless the owner has authorized access to it (e.g. to an individual, to a role or to a group of individuals). This granting or changing of access must be logged and the access control lists regularly reviewed by the owner. This also means we follow the principle of discretionary access control, meaning that owners of data grant access to this data by themselves.

Confidential data: We generally do not tag or otherwise mark confidential information. Instead we store information in secure repositories and grant access to information only when there is a legitimate need to it ("need-to-know"-access). Unauthorized access must be prevented with the features of the tools you are using. E.g. you should set links to a file with the correct sharing permission. Before sharing confidential data with individuals outside the Rocket.Chat organization, an NDA must be signed. This NDA signature is the responsiblity of the HR team for employees and contractors and of the Sales team for potential clients and customers. In case you are in doubt of the existence of an NDA, contact these teams respectively before sharing confidential data. For confidential information shared from us to customers or other external parties (e.g. a slidedeck), you must tag it with the Rocket.Chat logo to indicate its origin and minimize intellectual property infringement. Where the context warrants an additional note to the recipient, you should consider putting a footer like "Confidential material. Do not reproduce" on your document. Secure ways of sharing data (e.g. PGP-encrypted mailing, end-to-end encrypted channels on Rocket.Chat) should be preferred. For sending confidential material via hardcopy, only use legitimate mail services and avoid marking that draws attention to the content of the package.

Public data: Public data is also not marked specifically, instead it is characterized as being public when you put it on a place where the intended audience can access it (e.g. on our website or a public GitHub repository). To distinguish public data and confidential data, consider where it is being placed. Consider also that all data you put on the web is potentially replicated in other places (e.g. wayback machine, reupload on youtube, etc.) so be sure to check in advance if the data in question is really intended to be public.

Customer Data Classification: For information that is received from customers or regularly exchanged with them (e.g. slidedecks, RFQs, etc.) stick to the customer´s classification method and mark it appropriately.

Other handling and marking methods depending on tools and systems you use: When you work with specific tools and systems, these systems often come with their own classification schemes (e.g. GitHub Public vs Private Repositories) and mechanisms (access control lists, metadata, etc.). You should use these classification mechanisms in the spirit of this policy and the context of how you use the system.

### Deletion of data:

Once data is considered no longer necessary, it should be deleted. Keep in mind that we are required to keep certain data for a minimum or maximum amount of time (e.g. for legal reasons). Use secure methods for deleting data, e.g. [DBAN](https://dban.org/) Contact the security team in case you are in doubt of deleting data. Public data generally does not need to be deleted since the risk associated with it is low and our external audience often expects this data to be available (e.g. in our public source code repositories).
