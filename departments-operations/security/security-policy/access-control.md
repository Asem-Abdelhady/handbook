Access to sensitive or internal systems is critical for the security and confidentiality of Rocket.Chat. This policy and procedure help to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to these systems and that access is granted based on job responsibilities. It is the responsibility of all employees to follow this policy and report any suspected security breaches.

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who require access to sensitive or internal systems within the organization.

## Policy

Access to sensitive or internal systems must be requested through the company's Security department.

All requests for access must be approved by the employee's manager and the Security department.

Access to sensitive or internal systems will only be granted to authorized personnel who require access to perform their job responsibilities.

Access to sensitive or internal systems will be reviewed periodically to ensure continued access is necessary.

Employees who leave the organization must have their access to sensitive or internal systems terminated immediately.

## Procedure

### Requesting Access

* The employee must complete an access request form, which can be obtained in the link in the top of this page.
* The employee's manager must review and approve the request.
* The Security department will review the request and verify the employee's need for access.

### Reviewing Access

* Access to sensitive or internal systems will be reviewed periodically to ensure continued access is necessary.
* Managers must notify the Security department of any changes to an employee's job responsibilities that may impact their need for access to sensitive or internal systems.
* If access is no longer necessary, the Security department will revoke access to the systems.

### Termination of Access

* When an employee leaves the organization, the employee's manager must notify the Security department immediately.
