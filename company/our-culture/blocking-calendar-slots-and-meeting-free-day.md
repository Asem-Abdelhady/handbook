# Blocking Calendar Slots and Meeting Free Day

**Objective:**

We highly encourage you to reserve slots on your calendar and have Thursday as a meeting free day. This is focused on reduce the context-switching of the day-to-day activities and allow you to focus on critical items.

Please note we trust each Rocketers common sense on making the best use of guidelines presented here.

Having said this, the purpose of this page is to share general guidelines on these calendar slot blockers.

**General Guidelines:**

**1. Blocking your calendar**

In case you are setting slots of time on your calendar for focused individual work, place an event calendar entry on your agenda starting with title “Reserved” or “Blocked” and set its duration.

**2. Meeting Free Thursdays**

For meeting free Thurdays set an public out of office calendar entry for full day starting on any given Thursday.  
PS: Please note at this point this is being used only by Engineering Squads. 

You can set it to automatically decline meetings and automatic message “Auto-Declined. Thursdays are Meeting-Free Days. See handbook for more details:”
