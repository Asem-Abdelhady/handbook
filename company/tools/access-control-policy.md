# Access Control Policy

In this page you can find the process description of the opening, changes and removal of access to all systems used in Rocket.Chat, along with area or role specific platforms, the permission level rules and department responsible for each system.&#x20;

A periodic review of privileges and accesses must be performed by each area responsible for the system.

## Onboarding

The access control for the onboarding is facilitated by the onboarding process ClickUp templates, which lists the systems the new Rocketeer should receive access to. All invites are sent on the Rocketeers' first day in the company, except to G Suite, to which the Rocketeers are invited to during their previous week so they can get access to the calendar and use it to create their open.rocket.chat account.&#x20;

The list includes platforms open to the whole company and area specific platforms.

Permission levels listed as "User" refer to platforms where there are no specific level attributions, and users are simply created.

Members can also request access to other platforms according to necessity during their time in Rocket.Chat - like Loom, Greenhouse and italki -, since the access to it isn't released to everyone during onboarding.
