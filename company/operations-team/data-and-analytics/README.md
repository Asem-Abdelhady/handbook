### How we work

The Data & Analytics team is one of the main Cross-Functional Teams at Rocket.Chat, working closely together with several other teams and departments. One can find more info about how we interact with these other departments [here](https://handbook.rocket.chat/company/operations-team/data-and-analytics/data-as-a-cross-functional-team). Due to this characteristic, we receive a lot of new data product requests. 

To better triage these requests and properly assign capacity to them, we developed a form called "Data Request Form", where the requestee must provide extensive details about which kind of data they need, how are they going to use it, main stakeholders, etc.
