# Data as a Cross-Functional Team

The Data & Analytics Team is one of the most important teams in Rocket.Chat due to its strong cross-functional nature. In this document, you'll find how we act together with many other teams and departments to deliver value and apply data insights into our business strategies.

### Sales & RevOps

Data and RevOps work closely together in visualizing sales performance, forecasting scenarios, churn rates, data modeling, etc. Further, RevOps functions as a bridge between Data and the Sales department.

Most common interactions between us:

* Creating and maintaining Dashboards, Charts, and Reports;
* Changes in CRM should be reflected in Analytics. Every now and then, RevOps changes fields, adds features, and comes up with new business logic in our CRM. It's our job to create, adapt and maintain reports based on that data;
* Providing specific visualizations and reports: Zoho has a feature called [Query Tables](https://www.zoho.com/analytics/help/query-tables.html), enabling us to create complex data modeling tables based on Sales Data;
* Providing Dashboards with usage data enabling sales cycle reductions.
