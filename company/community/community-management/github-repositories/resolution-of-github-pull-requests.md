# Resolution of Github Pull Requests

Github Pull Requests are code contributions made by our code contributors \(both internal staff and community members\).   The objective of this process is to expedite the resolution of Github PRs created by our community of contributors.  

Most healthy open source project maintains a queue of PRs waiting to be merged.  Maintaining this queue at a reasonable length and avoiding heavy backlog of important PR from lead community contributor is the sub-goals of this process.

1.    With each incoming Pull Request, community Team Member triage the Pull Request to determine if it is immediately resolvable 
2.    Community Team Member will resolve the PR if possible. 
3.    If not immediately resolvable, Community Team Member will: \* label the Issue for the correct development squad \* move the issue title to Clickup list &lt;here&gt; i\* nterface with and notify development management via DM and Clickup
4.
