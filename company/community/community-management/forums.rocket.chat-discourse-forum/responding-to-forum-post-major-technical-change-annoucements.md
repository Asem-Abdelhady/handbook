# Responding to forum post \(Major technical/change annoucements\)

In some cases, when a major technical or change announcement is made, intense community participation and/or reaction is pre-anticipated.  To handle these situations in a productive and consistent manner, the Community Management Team has established \(and is evolving\) the following process.  
  
These announcements usually comprise of:  
  
\* an official announcement on forums.rocket.chat  by  CEO / CTO  \(or other executives\)  
\* a detailed technical document, linked to via the announcement, that explore in total technical details the actual change or elements of the announcement  
\* an Frequently Answered Question document capturing the official answer to the most anticipated and most asked questions  
  
These announcements also usually involve:  
\* product management team representing the need for change, or the rationale for the implementation  
\* product engineering team and members for the detailed technical interactions that are often required  
\* public relations team member  to ensure responses are consistent with the voice of the company   
\* documentation team member  to revise the technical document "Live", as well as tweaking the FAQ as more responses are created  
\* community team member to handle the actual response and to make sure community comments are adequately addressed and technical matter adequately resolved
