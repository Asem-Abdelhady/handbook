# Accounts Payable Process

* **Rocket.Chat payments processing will always occur in 3 fixed dates during the month: on the 10th, 20th and 30th of each month.**
  * Exception for February, where payments will be made on the last day of the month. 
* **For any purchase of service/product, make sure you have agreed with the supplier that:**
  * Payment terms should be negotiated with minimum 15 days. In case of exception, please contact **Accounts Payable Team** to find a proper solution;
  * The suppliers invoices must be sent immediately, as soon as you receive it, to the email address: **accounts.payable@rocket.chat.** \(Please do not hold invoices with you\)
  * **The Accounts Payable Team expects to receive the invoices at least 15 days in advance of the due date** in time to proper record, provisioning and schedule the payments.

**Responsibilities**  


It is very important that buyers inform such protocols to the suppliers in order to avoid any misunderstanding. 

**If the invoice due date is not in accordance with this policy,** the payment date will be automatically adjusted for the next fixed date of the month, as set above, and it will be the buyer's responsibility to contact the supplier and inform the adjustment, without any charge of interest or considered as delayed payment.
