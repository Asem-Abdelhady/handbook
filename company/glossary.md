# Glossary

## Metrics

#### Prospect:

* Visitors on the website or any other medium although they didn’t share any type of personal/company information nor interest \(sources\).
* Responsible: Marketing

#### Lead:

* Someone that expresses interest and shares more information that has:
  * Shared personal information but no company information  
  * Registered on newsletter, events, etc
* Responsible: Marketing

#### Marketing Qualified Lead \(MQL\):

* Someone that expresses interest and shares more information regarding the company that has:
  * Shared individual and company information
* This is the point where the lead is ready to talk to an SDR
* Responsible: Marketing

#### Product Qualified Lead \(PQL\):

* Someone that has engaged on a free trial or in our community version and has a score above a threshold taking into account: size, industry and country.
* This is the point where the lead is ready to talk to an SDR
* Responsible: Marketing and Product

#### Sales Qualified Lead \(SQL\):

* Someone that the SDR has already talked to and fits the target profile, has the pain identified and the timing is right.
  * At this stage, the SDR will have already talked to the client and identified a potential opportunity \(need, time, authority, budget\) 
* This is the point where the lead is ready to talk to a closer
* Responsible: Sales \(SDR\)

**Forecasting Category \(Zoho CRM\):**

* Commit: either a late-stage deal OR a well-progressed deal that the rep says will close as part of their forecast for the current quarter. All deals in Verbal Approval with a closing date in the current quarter must be selected as Commit
* Best Case: upside or viable opportunities that could be accelerated to close in this quarter or are advancing with solid chances for us to eventually win. Rep has a solid amount of confidence on closing but may miss a key "SPICED" element such as decision-maker, timing, OR any other. Two things must be certain though, that we can solve their PAIN and they see IMPACT.
* Early Stage: uncertainty on many key elements of the SPICED framework that limit the ability to have any higher confidence level or inclusion in committed forecast number.
* Omitted: For just created opportunity or super early prospecting/discovery analysis. Opportunities may only exist because the company is in our ICP. Likely only "situation" or no elements of the SPICED framework have been identified/validated.

**Forecasting Scenarios:**

* Optimistic: 
  * Commit = 100%; Best Case = 50%; Early Stage = 10%
* Base:
  * Commit = 90%; Best Case = 40%; Early Stage = 0%
* Conservative:
  * Commit = 80%; Best Case = 35%; Early Stage = 0%

#### Lagged Contracts:

* New Sale / Upsell contracts closed at t, but starting at t + 1 \(i.e. closed in April, but starts in May\)

#### Contract Consumption:

* How much \(%\) of the total contract has been consumed.

#### Logos:

* Synonym for "Company" used in the context of Logo Churn and New Logo.

#### Opportunity \(Opp\):

* Someone that was verified by the sales team \(closer/hunter\) that benefits from the product and passes the SLA of opportunity.
  * At this stage, the Closer will have already talked to the client and identified an opportunity \(need, time, authority, budget\) 
* Responsible: Sales \(Closer\)

#### ACV = Annual Contract Value:

* All contracts \(Non-recurring such as Events and Professional services included\)
* Value of contracts on a yearly basis
* Contracts that are &gt; 12 months will be annualized
* Contracts that are &lt; 12 months won’t be annualized

#### TCV = Total Contract Value:

* Takes into account non-recurring businesses 
* "Amount" field in Zoho CRM fields
* Back to our previous example Ex1 = $10k and Ex2 = $10k

#### Bookings ARR \(Annual Recurring Revenue\):

* **Deprecated since Feb 2021**
* Only recurring contracts \(events and professional services not included\)
* Value of contracts on a yearly basis
* Contracts that are &gt; 12 months will be annualized
* Contracts that are &lt; 12 months won’t be annualized

Ex1: 2 year contract worth $10k - Bookings ARR = $5k

Ex2: 6 month contract worth $10k - Bookings ARR = $10k
